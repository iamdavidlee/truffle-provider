Beefed up Provider utility for Truffle

-----------------------

### :warning: This repo is deprecated :warning:
**Truffle has moved all modules to a monorepo at [trufflesuite/truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle). See you over there!**

-----------------------

The goal of this module is to turn it into a provider object that contains extra utility methods that apply to the provider; however, in it's current state it simply a set of standalone utility functions.
